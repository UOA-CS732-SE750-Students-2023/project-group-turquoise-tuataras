# Introduction

Plan My Plate is Turqoise Tuataras' CS732/SE750 Web Composition Project. 
It is a meal schedule preparation website that allows users to search for recipes and plan their meals for the week. 
Users can save recipes, add them to a meal schedule, generate a shopping list, and find nearby supermarkets.
The application makes use of the Spoonacular API for obtaining recipe data, and Google Maps API for location information.
